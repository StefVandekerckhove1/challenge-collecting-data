## remarks
  - Nice tasks division explanations
  - flat architecture and a lot of csv files, it's messy, please create folders (data, src,...) to organize your files
  - how to use the code? no main.py so I guess I have to execute immo_get_urls.py first but it's not clear. Make sure your "usage" content is clear
  - No main.py so no code orchestration. No OOP logic, you did no create classes or even functions. This is not good practice, please use the OOP potentiality of Python :smile:
  - A few things to improve but the code is working and the dataset is complete, it's a good project :fire:
